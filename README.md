# Computational Mathematics: An Introduction to Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing with Python

This repository contains some of the computer code presented in the book "Computational Mathematics: Introduction to Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing with Python" by D. Mitsotakis. The computer code has been included in Jupyter notebooks and can be used for teaching and learning activities. 

The codes have been also corrected and modified appropriately so as to work in the most current version of Python.

The Jupyter notebooks are named after the corresponding chapters, and additional computer codes can be found under different names.
